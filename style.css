classmates who discussed the Save Table button idea from our class discord server (I did NOT take code or advice from anyone to do this)
Brief Overview: I FURTHER updated my webpage that lets a user enter a column lower bound, a column upper bound,
a row lower bound, and a row upper bound. If the user doesn't enter a valid input in any of the forms, 
then an appropriate error message will be displayed underneath the "Submit" button. ADDITIONALLY, I added 
custom form-specific error messages that will display underneath the specific form where the error is.
There are now sliders below each bound form, as well as messages that appear dynamically. 
Once all the error messages have been cleared, the user can update the multiplication table dynamically with the sliders.
There is a new "Save Table" button that appears below the "SUbmit" button, and when a table is being displayed, the "Save Table"
button appears underneath it. The user can click this button to save their current table in a new tab. 
I didn't add css styling to the new tabs, the tables are displayed in plaintext in a neat grid format.
I couldn't figure out how to do that with my "lowerBoundLarger" messages, so I kept the function as it originally
was in HW 3. I also kept the original error messages from my "rangeValidation" function, so there can be two sets 
of messages that appear: ones specific to each form where the error is, and ones that appear below the "submit" button.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out how to make the table scrollable, so it will stretch across
the page for larger inputs (didn't fix this from HW 3). I also didn't fix the "range" issue (from -50 to 50) from HW 3.
This code isn't as commented as Part 1, I only commented parts that were brand-new to this code.
